3. Navigate to the specific algorithm folder (e.g., `logistic_regression`, `decision_trees`, `naive_bayes`) and run the corresponding Python script.

4. Adjust the input data and parameters as required, or use the provided sample datasets.

5. Execute the script to train the algorithm on the data and generate the classification results or other relevant outputs.

## Datasets
